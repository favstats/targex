### Studying online political microtargeting before 2022


+ Poor data access

  + Meta Ad Library Data has many shortcomings (Leerssen et al. 2021)
  
      + no actual targeting criteria
  
  + Google only provides data on few (official) political actors
  
--

+ Alternatives (?)

  + Use "Why am I seeing this?" labels
     
  + only accessible via data donations 
     
      + scarce coverage and biased data
     
  + Risk of getting banned by platforms (NYU case 2021)

        
---

### Data on Ad Targeting in 2023

+ September 2022 Meta gives *vetted researchers* access to an "ad targeting dataset"

    + Includes **actual** targeting criteria used in Social Issue, Electoral, and Political (SIEP) ads on the **ad-level**
    
    + Coverage
    
        + All countries in which political ads run
        
        + August 3rd, 2020 - today (monthly updates)
        
        + Limited to using data on the Meta internal FORT platform
  
--

**Targeting of audiences by:**

+ Age, Gender, and Language

**Targeting and Exclusion (!) of audiences by:**

+ Location, "Interests", Custom and Lookalike audiences (and more)

class: middle, center

## Aims of this Research

**Descriptive Data Analysis of Political Microtargeting**

**Worldwide Context (not just US, UK and some Europe)**

---

## Research Questions

+ RQ1: Assessing the Scale

  + How big is the phenomenon of online political microtargeting?

&lt;!-- How much money do political parties spend on targeted ads vs. ads that are targeted towards entire country?  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Split up by country, party type and family/ideology. --&gt;

+ RQ2: Who (Doesn't) Target You?

  + Who are political parties including and excluding when they target their advertisements on Meta?


&lt;!-- 1.	who are the most targeted audiences --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2.	who are the most excluded audiences --&gt;
&lt;!-- 3.	how this differs by country/party type and family/ideology --&gt;

+ Final target sample: 
  + **85 countries** 
  + **105 elections** 
  + 16 countries placed no ads on Meta and are excluded

+ Only focus on **political parties and candidates**

## Conclusion

+ Online Political Microtargeting is common around the world


+ Future studies on microtargeting should consider broadening their research horizon beyond US, UK, and Europe

+ The Ad Targeting Dataset released by is a step in the right direction

  + however, the dataset is not easily accessible by civil society
  
  
+ Political parties seem to often target their own supporter base

  + to be investigated further!

## APPENDIX



---

#### RQ1 How big is the phenomena of Political Microtargeting?

    
### First Issue: Meta Ad Targeting Dataset is Messy

*How do we identify political actors advertising on Meta?*

1. Hand-labeled data: Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany

2. Self-identified labels as "political" party/candidate etc.

    - scrape this from the Facebook Ad Library (have done this for 180k+ advertisers)
    
![](img/tags.png)


---

### Netherlands

![](img/NL)

---

### Germany

![](img/DE)

---

### Denmark

![](img/DK)

---


### Second Issue: Which party do advertisers belong to?

1. Matching using party names and abbreviations -&gt; can be messy!
    + this may include also searching for content of ads

2. (Automated) Wikipedia search (especially for candidates)

3. Let ChatGPT do it? ;')



---

## Validation of Automated Matching

1. Make sure we are not missing any influential spenders
    + Retrieve 50 Top Spenders for each election
    + Retrieve 50 Top Spenders who were automatically not matched
    + hand-label them

2. From the rest, draw a random sample of 100 matched and non-matched advertisers
    + hand-label them
    + make sure we also have smaller advertisers cause they count as well
    
20 Elections X 200 Hand-labelling = 4000 coding task
    
    
---

## Questions

Does anyone have ideas about how to

1. maximize coverage (more countries)
2. keep data quality high (other validation methods)

One other idea: classify with machine learning model that is out there? I know Google can identify names and logos from images.. but can it also identify political party from names?

---

## Conclusion

End the paper with a research agenda: what should we research in the future? 



**Thanks for listening!**

## Some Rest


---

&lt;br&gt;

+ February 2021 Meta gives *vetted researchers* access to an "ad targeting dataset"

    + **Actual** targeting criteria used in Social Issue, Electoral, and Political (SIEP) ads on the **ad-level**
    
    + through the FORT platform (**F**acebook **O**pen **R**esearch and **T**ransparency) 
    
    + Timeframe: August 3rd - November 1st , 2020
    
    + Coverage: Only the United States
    
    + Difficult to get access
    
---


### Data on Ad Targeting


+ September 2022: Meta adds "Audience" tab to public Meta Ad Library  

    + Coverage: All countries in which political ads run
    
    + Targeting criteria: Age, Gender, Location, Language, "Interests" and "Behaviour", Custom and Lookalike Audiences 
    
    + Downside: only available for last 7, 30, and 90 days windows
    
    + No possibility to download data (however: I've written an R package to be released to access data)
        
![](img/targeting2.png)

### Previous studies suggest advertisers on Meta primarily target own supporters

**Fowler et al. 2021** conclude in their comprehensive study on Meta ad targeting in the 2018 US midterm election


&gt; "all point[s] toward the use of social media ads for **mobilization of existing supporters** as opposed to persuasion of marginal voters"

&lt;!-- based on three factors: --&gt;

&lt;!-- + reduced negativity --&gt;
&lt;!-- + lower issue content --&gt;
&lt;!-- + increased partisanship --&gt;

&lt;!-- compared to TV ads --&gt;

**Ridout et al. 2021:**

&gt; More than 50% of ads are **acquisition, fundraising, and mobilization** ads in selected Senate races on Meta.

**Stuckelberger and Koedam 2022:**

&gt; Our analysis across five countries [...] suggests that **coalition maintenance** is the dominant party strategy for demographic groups.

### Evidence that parties target supporters (WTM data)

&lt;img src="img/wtm.png"   width="95%"  /&gt;

## Theories for who gets targeted &amp; 
## who gets excluded



---

### Theories for who gets targeted &amp; who gets excluded


#### Coalition Maintenance vs. Expansion strategies 

*Based on Rohrschneider 2002; Panagopoulos and Wielhouwer 2008; Stuckelberger and Koedam 2022*

&lt;br&gt;

+ **Coalition maintenance strategy** (*"mobilizing"*)

    + Reach out to people who are past and present supporters to strengthen coalition 

+  **Coalition expansion strategy** (*"chasing"*)

    + Target people who are potential voters or yet undecided to expand coalition 


---

### Theories for who gets targeted &amp; who gets excluded


#### **Consideration sets** 

*(Based on Oscarsson and Rosema 2019)*

+ Originally a marketing theory on consumer behaviour: 
    + set of products that consumer would be willing to buy based on certain criteria 
        + for example, price, brand, etc.


+ In electoral context: 
    + set of political parties citizen would vote for based on certain criteria 
        + e.g. ideological alignment, chances to govern, be in parliament, etc.
    
&lt;br&gt;
    
+ **In targeting context (from perspective of campaigns):**
    + set of audiences that a party chooses to advertise to 
        + e.g. based on **issue ownership**, past vote, ideological alignment, etc.
    + implies: audiences outside of consideration sets should be excluded

## Hypotheses

&gt; Parties target audiences within consideration set

&gt; Parties exclude audiences outside their consideration set

Maybe:

&gt; Smaller parties are more likely to engage in coalition expansion rather than coalition maintenance in an effort to gain votes from bigger competitors

---


## Requirements

1. Decide which elections should be studied

    + Suggestion: Netherlands 2021, Germany 2021, Canada 2021, Italy 2022, Sweden 2022, Denmark 2023 (?)
    + other elections: Lithuania 2020, Portugal 2020, Liechtenstein 2021, Bulgaria 2021, Cyprus 2021, Norway 2021, Iceland 2021, Czech Republic 2021, Hungary 2022, Slovenia 2022
    
2. Coding of targeting criteria into 
    
    +  **in consideration set**
        + Supporters                 
        + Potential voters       
        
    +  **outside of consideration set**
        + People who are not likely to vote for party
    
&gt; requires some expertise in studied countries

Question: what about targeting criteria that do not fit in any of these categories?

---

## Who targets who and why but.. also how?

+ So this research design does not incorporate at all **which messages** parties use to target people.

+ Is this a major flaw? Reasonable compromise?

### More questions

Does the theory idea make sense?

Any other suggestions?

Problem with the theory: what about political parties that want to **demobilize supporters of the opposing party**? That's not accounted for. However: is this even an issue outside of the US?
